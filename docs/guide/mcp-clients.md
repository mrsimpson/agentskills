# Connecting Agents

The MCP server (`agentskills-mcp`) communicates over stdio. Any MCP-compatible agent needs to know how to start it.

## Manual Configuration

Add this to your agent's MCP server configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentskills": {
      "command": "agentskills-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

If `agentskills-mcp` is not on your PATH, use the full path:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agentskills": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@codemcp/agentskills-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Automatic Configuration

The CLI can write the configuration for you:

```bash
agentskills install --with-mcp --agent <name>
```

Configs are placed in the project directory so they can be committed to version control.

## Agent Config Locations

| Agent | Config File |
|---|---|
| Claude Desktop | `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) |
| Cline | VS Code settings / `.cline/` |
| Continue | `.continue/config.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` |
| Junie | `.junie/` |
| Kiro | `.kiro/` (supports multiple config files) |
| Zed | `~/.config/zed/settings.json` |

## How It Works at Runtime

When an agent connects:

1. The MCP server loads all installed skills from `.agentskills/skills/`
2. It registers a `use_skill` tool with an enum of available skill names
3. It exposes each skill as a `skill://<name>` resource

The agent calls `use_skill(skill_name: "my-skill")` and receives the raw skill instructions. Argument interpolation (e.g., `$ARGUMENTS`, `$1`) is the agent's responsibility — the server passes content through unchanged.

::: tip Restart after changes
Skills are loaded at startup. After running `agentskills install`, restart the MCP server (usually by restarting your agent or reloading its window).
