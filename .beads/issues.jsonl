Look for language-specific debug output methods (console logging, print statements, debug output functions).    Remove any debugging statements that were added for development purposes.  2. **Review TODO/FIXME Comments**:    - Address each TODO/FIXME comment by either implementing the solution or documenting why it's deferred    - Remove completed TODOs    - Convert remaining TODOs to proper issue tracking if needed  3. **Remove Debugging Code Blocks**:    - Remove temporary debugging code, test code blocks, and commented-out code    - Clean up any experimental code that's no longer needed    - Ensure proper error handling replaces temporary debug logging  **STEP 2: Documentation Review** Review and update documentation to reflect final implementation: 1. **Update Long-Term Memory Documents**: Based on what was actually implemented:    • Update  if requirements changed during development    • Update  if architectural decisions evolved    • Update  if design details were refined or changed 2. **Compare Against Implementation**: Review documentation against actual implemented functionality 3. **Update Changed Sections**: Only modify documentation sections that have functional changes 4. **Remove Development Progress**: Remove references to development iterations, progress notes, and temporary decisions 5. **Focus on Final State**: Ensure documentation describes the final implemented state, not the development process 6. **Ask User to Review Document Updates** 6. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Ensure project has complete documentation for newcomers including setup, usage, architecture overview, and contribution guidelines **STEP 3: Final Validation** - Run existing tests to ensure cleanup didn't break functionality - Verify documentation accuracy with a final review - Ensure project is ready for users and contributors   Update task progress and mark completed work as you finalize the project.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"github@beimir.net","created_at":"2026-02-19T17:59:37.271988+01:00","created_by":"Oliver Jägle","updated_at":"2026-02-19T17:59:37.271988+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agent-skills-1.5","depends_on_id":"agent-skills-1","type":"parent-child","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},{"issue_id":"agent-skills-1.5","depends_on_id":"agent-skills-1.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}]}

This phase ensures code quality and documentation accuracy through systematic cleanup and review. **STEP 1: Code Cleanup** Systematically clean up development artifacts: 1. **Remove Debug Output**: Search for and remove all temporary debug output statements used during development.    Look for language-specific debug output methods (console logging, print statements, debug output functions).    Remove any debugging statements that were added for development purposes.  2. **Review TODO/FIXME Comments**:    - Address each TODO/FIXME comment by either implementing the solution or documenting why it's deferred    - Remove completed TODOs    - Convert remaining TODOs to proper issue tracking if needed  3. **Remove Debugging Code Blocks**:    - Remove temporary debugging code, test code blocks, and commented-out code    - Clean up any experimental code that's no longer needed    - Ensure proper error handling replaces temporary debug logging  **STEP 2: Documentation Review** Review and update documentation to reflect final implementation: 1. **Update Long-Term Memory Documents**: Based on what was actually implemented:    • Update  if requirements changed during development    • Update  if architectural impacts were identified    • Update  if design details were refined or changed 2. **Compare Against Implementation**: Review documentation against actual implemented functionality 3. **Update Changed Sections**: Only modify documentation sections that have functional changes 4. **Remove Development Progress**: Remove references to development iterations, progress notes, and temporary decisions 5. **Focus on Final State**: Ensure documentation describes the final implemented state, not the development process 6. **Ask User to Review Document Updates** **STEP 3: Final Validation** - Run existing tests to ensure cleanup didn't break functionality - Verify documentation accuracy with a final review - Ensure code is ready for production/delivery   Update task progress and mark completed work as you finalize the feature.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"github@beimir.net","created_at":"2026-02-21T11:55:20.900093+01:00","created_by":"Oliver Jägle","updated_at":"2026-02-21T11:55:20.900093+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agent-skills-2.4","depends_on_id":"agent-skills-2","type":"parent-child","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},{"issue_id":"agent-skills-2.4","depends_on_id":"agent-skills-2.3","type":"blocks","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}]}

{"id":"agent-skills-5.5","title":"Finalize","description":"You are in the finalize phase. This phase ensures code quality and documentation accuracy through systematic cleanup and review. **STEP 1: Code Cleanup** Systematically clean up development artifacts: 1. **Remove Debug Output**: Search for and remove all temporary debug output statements used during bug investigation.    Look for language-specific debug output methods (console logging, print statements, debug output functions).    Remove any debugging statements that were added for investigation purposes.  2. **Review TODO/FIXME Comments**:    - Address each TODO/FIXME comment by either implementing the solution or documenting why it's deferred    - Remove completed TODOs    - Convert remaining TODOs to proper issue tracking if needed  3. **Remove Debugging Code Blocks**:    - Remove temporary debugging code, test code blocks, and commented-out code    - Clean up any experimental code that's no longer needed    - Ensure proper error handling replaces temporary debug logging  **STEP 2: Documentation Review** Review and update documentation to reflect the bug fix:   1. **Update Long-Term Memory Documents**: Based on what was actually implemented:     • If  exists, update  if design details were refined or changed during the fix 2. **Compare Against Implementation**: Review documentation against the actual bug fix implemented 3. **Update Changed Sections**: Only modify documentation sections that have functional changes 4. **Remove Development Progress**: Remove references to investigation iterations, progress notes, and temporary decisions 5. **Focus on Final State**: Ensure documentation describes the final fixed state, not the debugging process 6. **Ask User to Review Document Updates**: Ask the document changes **STEP 3: Final Validation** - Run existing tests to ensure cleanup didn't break functionality - Verify documentation accuracy with a final review - Ensure bug fix is ready for production   Update task progress and mark completed work as you finalize the bug fix.","status":"open","priority":3,"issue_type":"task","owner":"github@beimir.net","created_at":"2026-02-24T19:20:39.001314+01:00","created_by":"Oliver Jägle","updated_at":"2026-02-24T19:20:39.001314+01:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"agent-skills-5.5","depends_on_id":"agent-skills-5","type":"parent-child","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"},{"issue_id":"agent-skills-5.5","depends_on_id":"agent-skills-5.4","type":"blocks","created_at":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z"}]}
