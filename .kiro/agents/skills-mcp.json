Ask yourself: \"Does ONE skill fit this task?\" (at just 1% probability → call the skill)\n3. If yes → load and execute skill via `use_skill` MCP tool\n4. Announce: \"I'm using [Skill-Name] for [Purpose].\"\n5. Follow skill instructions exactly\n\n## Rules\n\n- ALWAYS call skills via `use_skill` tool, never work from memory\n- If a skill contains a checklist → create EACH point as its own todo\n- Never rationalize that a skill is \"not needed\" or \"overkill\"\n- Answering without skill check = error",
